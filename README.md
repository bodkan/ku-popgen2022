# Notes on simulation for PopGen 2022 course

What's the goal here?

1. Focus on the practical aspects of popgen simulation (how to get to an immediately recognizable result ASAP).

2. Most of the learning curve involves programming:
- Knowing enough Python to do complex msprime simulations (dictionaries, classes/OOP, etc.)
- Being able or having the resources to learn a new programming language like SLiM.

3. Show that this is not magic, start with a very simple simulation of a single locus that can be implemented in R and immediately produces results recognizable from the literature.

## Prerequisites

- Working R installation (at least R 3.6, preferably 4.x)
- 
- RStudio recommended
